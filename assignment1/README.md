# 🛰️ Assignment 1 — Accelerations & Orbit Propagation

This folder contains the solution for **Assignment 1** of Satellite Orbit Determination (AE4872).  
The goal is to compute the main perturbing accelerations on a GRACE-FO satellite and evaluate their impact on numerical orbit propagation.

## 📎 Deliverables

- Plots of acceleration magnitudes  
- Orbit propagation comparisons  
- Code (exported to PDF)  
- Report with discussion
